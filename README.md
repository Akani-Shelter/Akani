## Project Vision and Objectives
The main purpose of this app is to create a personalized acquaintance network, connecting potential employers, be it companies or individuals with the Akani Shelter.  The Akani Shelter filters out individuals deemed job-worthy and uploads their details on the website, where employers can see their details and contact the Akani Shelter to get into contact with the individuals. Along with that the system also provides a chat functionality to facilitate contact between the shelter and the employers.
